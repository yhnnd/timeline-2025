Revelation 12

1 And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:

2 And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.

3 And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.

4 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.

5 And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.

6 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.

7 And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,

8 And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.

9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.

10 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.

11 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.

12 Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.

13 And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.

14 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.

15 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.

16 And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.

17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.

1 天上现出大异象来。有一个妇人，身披日头，脚踏月亮，头戴十二星的冠冕。 2 她怀了孕，在生产的艰难中疼痛呼叫。 3 天上又现出异象来。有一条大红龙，七头十角，七头上戴着七个冠冕。 4 它的尾巴拖拉着天上星辰的三分之一，摔在地上。龙就站在那将要生产的妇人面前，等她生产之后，要吞吃她的孩子。 5 妇人生了一个男孩子，是将来要用铁杖辖管万国的（辖管原文作牧）。她的孩子被提到神宝座那里去了。 6 妇人就逃到旷野，在那里有神给她预备的地方，使她被养活一千二百六十天。

7 在天上就有了争战。米迦勒同他的使者与龙争战。龙也同它的使者去争战。 8 并没有得胜，天上再没有它们的地方。 9 大龙就是那古蛇，名叫魔鬼，又叫撒但，是迷惑普天下的。它被摔在地上，它的使者也一同被摔下去。 10 我听见在天上有大声音说，我神的救恩，能力，国度，并他基督的权柄，现在都来到了。因为那在我们神面前昼夜控告我们弟兄的，已经被摔下去了。 11 弟兄胜过它，是因羔羊的血，和自己所见证的道。他们虽至于死，也不爱惜性命。 12 所以诸天和住在其中的，你们都快乐吧。只是地与海有祸了，因为魔鬼知道自己的时候不多，就气忿忿地下到你们那里去了。

13 龙见自己被摔在地上，就逼迫那生男孩子的妇人。 14 于是有大鹰的两个翅膀赐给妇人，叫她能飞到旷野，到自己的地方，躲避那蛇。她在那里被养活一载二载半载。 15 蛇就在妇人身后，从口中吐出水来像河一样，要将妇人冲去。 16 地却帮助妇人，开口吞了从龙口吐出来的水。（原文作河） 17 龙向妇人发怒，去与她其余的儿女争战，这儿女就是那守神诫命，为耶稣作见证的。那时龙就站在海边的沙上。

Revelation 13

1 And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.

2 And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.

3 And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.

4 And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?

5 And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.

6 And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.

7 And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.

8 And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

9 If any man have an ear, let him hear.

10 He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.

11 And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.

12 And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.

13 And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,

14 And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.

15 And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.

16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:

17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.

18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.

1 我又看见一个兽从海中上来，有十角七头，在十角上戴着十个冠冕，七头上有亵渎的名号。 2 我所看见的兽，形状像豹，脚像熊的脚，口像狮子的口。那龙将自己的能力，座位，和大权柄，都给了它。 3 我看见兽的七头中，有一个似乎受了死伤。那死伤却医好了。全地的人，都希奇跟从那兽。 4 又拜那龙，因为它将自己的权柄给了兽。也拜兽说，谁能比这兽，谁能与它交战呢？

5 又赐给它说夸大亵渎话的口。又有权柄赐给它，可以任意而行四十二个月。 6 兽就开口向神说亵渎的话，亵渎神的名，并他的帐幕，以及那些住在天上的。 7 又任凭它与圣徒争战，并且得胜。也把权柄赐给它，制伏各族各民各方各国。 8 凡住在地上，名字从创世以来，没有记在被杀之羔羊生命册上的人，都要拜它。 9 凡有耳的，就应当听。 10 掳掠人的必被掳掠。用刀杀人的，必被刀杀。圣徒的忍耐和信心，就是在此。

11 我又看见另有一个兽从地中上来。有两角如同羊羔，说话好像龙。 12 它在头一个兽面前，施行头一个兽所有的权柄。并且叫地和住在地上的人，拜那死伤医好的头一个兽。 13 又行大奇事，甚至在人面前，叫火从天降在地上。 14 它因赐给它权柄在兽面前能行奇事，就迷惑住在地上的人，说，要给那受刀伤还活着的兽作个像。 15 又有权柄赐给它叫兽像有生气。并且能说话，又叫所有不拜兽像的人都被杀害。

16 它又叫众人，无论大小贫富，自主的，为奴的，都在右手上，或是在额上，受一个印记。 17 除了那受印记，有了兽名，或有兽名数目的，都不得作买卖。 18 在这里有智慧。凡有聪明的，可以算计兽的数目，因为这是人的数目。它的数目是六百六十六。

Revelation 14

1 And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads.

2 And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:

3 And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.

4 These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.

5 And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.

6 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,

7 Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.

8 And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.

9 And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,

10 The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:

11 And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.

12 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.

13 And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.

14 And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.

15 And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.

16 And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.

17 And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.

18 And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.

19 And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.

20 And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.

启示录 第 14 章

1 我又观看，见羔羊站在锡安山，同他又有十四万四千人，都有他的名，和他父的名，写在额上。 2 我听见从天上有声音，像众水的声音，和大雷的声音。并且我所听见的好像弹琴的所弹的琴声。 3 他们在宝座前，并在四活物和众长老前唱歌，仿佛是新歌。除了从地上买来的那十四万四千人以外，没有人能学这歌。 4 这些人未曾沾染妇女，他们原是童身。羔羊无论往哪里去，他们都跟随他。他们是从人间买来的，作初熟的果子归与神和羔羊。 5 在他们口中察不出谎言来。他们是没有瑕疵的。

6 我又看见另有一位天使飞在空中，有永远的福音要传给住在地上的人，就是各国各族各方各民。 7 他大声说，应当敬畏神，将荣耀归给他。因他施行审判的时候已经到了。应当敬拜那创造天地海和众水泉源的。

8 又有第二位天使，接着说，叫万民喝邪淫大怒之酒的巴比伦大城倾倒了，倾倒了。

9 又有第三位天使，接着他们，大声说，若有人拜兽和兽像，在额上，或在手上，受了印记， 10 这人也必喝神大怒的酒，此酒斟在神忿怒的杯中纯一不杂。他要在圣天使和羔羊面前，在火与硫磺之中受痛苦。 11 他受痛苦的烟往上冒，直到永永远远。那些拜兽和兽像受他名之印记的，昼夜不得安宁。 12 圣徒的忍耐就在此。他们是守神诫命，和耶稣真道的。

13 我听见从天上有声音说，你要写下，从今以后，在主里面而死的人有福了。圣灵说，是的，他们息了自己的劳苦，作工的果效也随着他们。

14 我又观看，见有一片白云，云上坐着一位好像人子，头上戴着金冠冕，手里拿着快镰刀。 15 又有一位天使从殿中出来，向那坐在云上的大声喊着说，伸出你的镰刀来收割。因为收割的时候已经到了，地上的庄稼已经熟透了。 16 那坐在云上的，就把镰刀扔在地上。地上的庄稼就被收割了。

17 又有一位天使从天上的殿中出来，他也拿着快镰刀。 18 又有一位天使从祭坛中出来，是有权柄管火的，向拿着快镰刀的大声喊着说，伸出快镰刀来收取地上葡萄树的果子。因为葡萄熟透了。 19 那天使就把镰刀扔在地上，收取了地上的葡萄，丢在神忿怒的大酒榨中。 20 那酒榨踹在城外，就有血从酒榨里流出来，高到马的嚼环，远有六百里。

Revelation 16

1 And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.

2 And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image.

3 And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.

4 And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.

5 And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.

6 For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.

7 And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.

8 And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.

9 And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory.

10 And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,

11 And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.

12 And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.

13 And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.

14 For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.

15 Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.

16 And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.

17 And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.

18 And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.

19 And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.

20 And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.

21 And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.

启示录 第 16 章

1 我听见有大声音从殿中出来，向那七位天使说，你们去，把盛神大怒的七碗倒在地上。

2 第一位天使便去，把碗倒在地上，就有恶而且毒的疮，生在那些有兽印记，拜兽像的人身上。

3 第二位天使把碗倒在海里，海就变成血，好像死人的血，海中的活物都死了。

4 第三位天使把碗倒在江河与众水的泉源里，水就变成血了。 5 我听见掌管众水的天使说，昔在今在的圣者阿，你这样判断是公义的。 6 他们曾流圣徒与先知的血，现在你给他们血喝。这是他们所该受的。 7 我又听见祭坛中有声音说，是的，主神，全能者阿，你的判断义哉，诚哉。

8 第四位天使把碗倒在日头上，叫日头能用火烤人。 9 人被大热所烤，就亵渎那有权掌管这些灾的神之名，并不悔改将荣耀归给神。

10 第五位天使把碗倒在兽的座位上，兽的国就黑暗了。人因疼痛就咬自己的舌头。 11 又因所受的疼痛，和生的疮，就亵渎天上的神。并不悔改所行的。

12 第六位天使把碗倒在伯拉大河上，河水就干了，要给那从日出之地所来的众王预备道路。 13 我又看见三个污秽的灵，好像青蛙，从龙口兽口并假先知的口中出来。 14 他们本是鬼魔的灵，施行奇事，出去到普天下众王那里，叫他们在神全能者的大日聚集争战。 15 （看哪，我来像贼一样。那儆醒，看守衣服，免得赤身而行，叫人见他羞耻的，有福了 16 那三个鬼魔便叫众王聚集在一处，希伯来话叫作哈米吉多顿。

17 第七位天使把碗倒在空中，就有大声音从殿中的宝座上出来，说，成了。 18 又有闪电，声音，雷轰，大地震，自从地上有人以来，没有这样大这样利害的地震。 19 那大城裂为三段，列国的城也都倒塌了。神也想起巴比伦大城来，要把那盛自己烈怒的酒杯递给他。 20 各海岛都逃避了，众山也不见了。 21 又有大雹子从天落在人身上，每一个约重一他连得。（一他连得约有九十斤）为这雹子的灾极大，人就亵渎神。

Revelation 17

1 And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:

2 With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.

3 So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.

4 And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:

5 And upon her forehead was a name written, Mystery, Babylon The Great, The Mother Of Harlots And Abominations Of The Earth.

6 And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.

7 And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.

8 The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.

9 And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.

10 And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.

11 And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.

12 And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.

13 These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.

14 These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.

15 And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.

16 And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.

17 For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.

18 And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.

启示录 第 17 章

1 拿着七碗的七位天使中，有一位前来对我说，你到这里来，我将坐在众水上的大淫妇所要受的刑罚指给你看。 2 地上的君王与她行淫。住在地上的人喝醉了她淫乱的酒。 3 我被圣灵感动，天使带我到旷野去。我就看见一个女人骑在朱红色的兽上。那兽有七头十角，遍体有亵渎的名号。 4 那女人穿着紫色和朱红色的衣服，用金子宝石珍珠为妆饰。手拿金杯，杯中盛满了可憎之物，就是她淫乱的污秽。 5 在她额上有名写着说，奥秘哉，大巴比伦，作世上的淫妇和一切可憎之物的母。 6 我又看见那女人喝醉了圣徒的血和为耶稣作见证之人的血。

我看见她，就大大地希奇。 7 天使对我说，你为什么希奇呢？我要将这女人和驮着她的那七头十角兽的奥秘告诉你。 8 你所看见的兽，先前有，如今没有。将要从无底坑里上来，又要归于沉沦。凡住在地上名字从创世以来没有记在生命册上的，见先前有，如今没有，以后再有的兽，就必希奇。 9 智慧的心在此可以思想。那七头就是女人所坐的七座山。 10 又是七位王。五位已经倾倒了，一位还在，一位还没有来到。他来的时候，必须暂时存留。 11 那先前有，如今没有的兽，就是第八位。他也和那七位同列，并且归于沉沦。 12 你所看见的那十角，就是十王。他们还没有得国。但他们一时之间，要和兽同得权柄与王一样。 13 他们同心合意，将自己的能力权柄给那兽。 14 他们与羔羊争战，羔羊必胜过他们，因为羔羊是万主之主，万王之王。同着羔羊的，就是蒙召被选有忠心的，也必得胜。 15 天使又对我说，你所看见那淫妇坐的众水，就是多民多人多国多方。 16 你所看见的那十角，与兽，必恨这淫妇，使她冷落赤身。又要吃她的肉，用火将她烧尽。 17 因为神使诸王同心合意，遵行他的旨意，把自己的国给那兽，直等到神的话都应验了。 18 你所看见的那女人，就是管辖地上众王的大城。

Revelation 18

1 And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.

2 And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.

3 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.

4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.

5 For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.

6 Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.

7 How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.

8 Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.

9 And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,

10 Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.

11 And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:

12 The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,

13 And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.

14 And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.

15 The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,

16 And saying, Alas, alas that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!

17 For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,

18 And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city!

19 And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.

20 Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.

21 And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.

22 And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;

23 And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.

24 And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.

启示录 第 18 章

1 此后，我看见另有一位有大权柄的天使从天降下。地就因他的荣耀发光。 2 他大声喊着说，巴比伦大城倾倒了，倾倒了，成了鬼魔的住处，和各样污秽之灵的巢穴（或作牢狱下同），并各样污秽可憎之雀鸟的巢穴。 3 因为列国都被她邪淫大怒的酒倾倒了。地上的君王与她行淫，地上的客商，因她奢华太过就发了财。 4 我又听见从天上有声音说，我的民哪，你们要从那城出来，免得与她一同有罪，受她所受的灾殃。 5 因她的罪恶滔天，她的不义神已经想起来了。 6 她怎样待人，也要怎样待她，按她所行的加倍地报应她。用她调酒的杯，加倍地调给她喝。 7 她怎样荣耀自己，怎样奢华，也当叫她照样痛苦悲哀。因她心里说，我坐了皇后的位，并不是寡妇，决不至于悲哀。 8 所以在一天之内，她的灾殃要一齐来到，就是死亡，悲哀，饥荒，她又要被火烧尽了。因为审判她的主神大有能力。

9 地上的君王，素来与她行淫一同奢华的，看见烧她的烟，就必为她哭泣哀号。 10 因怕她的痛苦，就远远地站着说，哀哉，哀哉，巴比伦大城，坚固的城阿，一时之间你的刑罚就来到了。

11 地上的客商也都为她哭泣悲哀，因为没有人再买他们的货物了。 12 这货物就是金，银，宝石，珍珠，细麻布，紫色料，绸子，朱红色料，各样香木，各样象牙的器皿，各样极宝贵的木头和铜，铁，汉白玉的器皿， 13 并肉桂，豆蔻，香料，香膏，乳香，酒，油，细面，麦子，牛，羊，车，马，和奴仆，人口。

14 巴比伦哪，你所贪爱的果子离开了你。你一切的珍馐美味，和华美的物件，也从你中间毁灭，决不能再见了。

15 贩卖这些货物，借着她发了财的客商，因怕她的痛苦，就远远地站着哭泣悲哀，说， 16 哀哉，哀哉，这大城阿，素常穿着细麻，紫色，朱红色的衣服，又用金子，宝石，和珍珠为妆饰。 17 一时之间，这么大的富厚就归于无有了。

凡船主，和坐船往各处去的，并众水手，连所有靠海为业的，都远远地站着， 18 看见烧她的烟，就喊着说，有何城能比这大城呢？ 19 他们又把尘土撒在头上，哭泣悲哀，喊着说，哀哉，哀哉，这大城阿。凡有船在海中的，都因她的珍宝成了富足。她在一时之间就成了荒场。 20 天哪，众圣徒众使徒众先知阿，你们都要因她欢喜。因为神已经在她身上伸了你们的冤。

21 有一位大力的天使举起一块石头，好像大磨石，扔在海里，说，巴比伦大城，也必这样猛力的被扔下去，决不能再见了。 22 弹琴，作乐，吹笛，吹号的声音，在你中间决不能再听见。各行手艺人在你中间决不能再遇见。推磨的声音在你中间决不能再听见。 23 灯光在你中间决不能再照耀。新郎和新妇的声音，在你中间决不能再听见。你的客商原来是地上的尊贵人。万国也被你的邪术迷惑了。 24 先知和圣徒，并地上一切被杀之人的血，都在这城里看见了。
