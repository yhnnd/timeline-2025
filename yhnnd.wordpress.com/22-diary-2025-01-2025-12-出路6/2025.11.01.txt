In the autumn of 1987, the port city of Zhoushan舟山, perched along the eastern coast of Zhejiang Province, became the stage for a deeply personal reunion that echoed decades of political and social upheaval. A war veteran, having been separated from his family for forty long years, returned from Taiwan, navigating a landscape transformed by economic reform and the tentative thawing of Cross-Strait relations. The streets, once quiet and punctuated by fishing boats and the clang of harbor activity, now bustled with trucks, bicycles, and the faint hum of television propaganda. For the veteran, every alley and quay carried the weight of memory: the home he left behind in the early 1940s, the chaos of wartime evacuations, and the uncertain decades spent apart from his loved ones.

The journey back from Taiwan was more than a crossing of waters; it symbolized the slow, fragile reconciliation between divided communities and families after decades of political estrangement. Since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, countless families had been split, with the straits serving as both physical and emotional barriers. Zhoushan, with its intricate archipelago and centuries-old fishing traditions, had witnessed both the flight of refugees and the arrival of soldiers, merchants, and bureaucrats, embedding stories of separation and resilience into its very architecture. Yuan Xuejun袁学军’s photograph captures the moment with poignant clarity: the veteran, weathered yet upright, his gaze fixed on a familiar doorway or distant harbor, embodying both the endurance of the human spirit and the indelible scars of history.

The 1987 reunion became emblematic not only of personal restoration but also of the broader, delicate thaw between Taiwan and mainland China. In that moment, amid the ebbing tides of Zhoushan’s harbors, the veteran’s return illuminated the intimate costs of decades-long political division, while simultaneously celebrating the resilience of family, memory, and identity. His story, frozen in Yuan’s lens, continues to resonate as a testament to the power of reunion, the passage of time, and the enduring hope that even the longest separations may one day yield to human connection.
